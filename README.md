# gpa-calculator
This program alculates your weighted and unweighted grade point averages. It includes input for your unweighted scale, weighted scale, and classes that you are taking. It also includes memory through the json files to hold one person's classes and grades at a time. This program does not account for term grades/semester grades with only one letter grade for each class. If you want to calculate your overall GPA, you must average your grades on your own and then use the gpa calculator for your grades. 

When using the GPA Calculator, please run the **main.py** file, and make sure you have all the files nessecary in the module. If you have any questions or concerns about this program, please email me at 24TangC@nsboroschools.net
